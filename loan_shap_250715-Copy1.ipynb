      "\n",

      "*   **Married (0.0346):** Being married is a plus. Lenders often see married couples as more stable.\n",
      "*   **Dependents (0.0615):** Having dependents (you mentioned a household of three) is a positive. This suggests you're responsible and likely have a stable home life.\n",
      "*   **Education (0.0169):** Your graduate degree is a positive factor. Higher education often correlates with higher earning potential.\n",
      "*   **Self-Employed (0.0185):** Being self-employed is viewed as a slight positive.\n",
      "*   **Applicant Income (0.0001):** Your income of 50 million KRW is a very slight positive factor.\n",
      "*   **Coapplicant Income (0.003):** The additional 10 million KRW from your co-applicant is another small boost.\n",
      "*   **Credit History (0.0683):** This is a significant positive! Your credit history of '1' (we'll need to clarify what this exactly means, as mentioned in the factual information) is helping your application. A good credit history shows you're reliable with repayments.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Challenges (Minus Factors):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Loan Amount (-0.1036):** This is the biggest challenge. The 450 million KRW loan amount is a significant negative factor. Larger loans always carry more risk for the lender.\n",
      "*   **Loan Amount Term (-0.093):** The 2-year loan term is also a negative. Shorter loan terms mean higher monthly payments, which can be a concern for lenders.\n",
      "*   **Property Area (-0.0353):** The rural area where you're looking to buy is a negative factor. Lenders sometimes see rural properties as less liquid (harder to sell) if they need to foreclose.\n",

      "**In Summary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "You have several strong points working in your favor: your marital status, dependents, education, self-employment, and especially your credit history. Your income and co-applicant income also provide a small boost.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the size of the loan and the short repayment term are significant hurdles. The rural location of the property also presents a challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Next Steps (Based on Factual Information):**\n",
      "\n",
      "To get a more accurate picture and find the best mortgage options, we need a little more information:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Location Detail:** Is the property located in a \"gun\" (군, a specific type of rural area), or is the loan itself specifically targeted for rural areas?\n",

      "Think of these factors as either helping or hindering your chances of getting the most favorable jeonse loan terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Factors Working *Against* You (Minus Factors):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Gender (-0.0033):** Being male had a very, very slight negative impact. In general, some loan programs might have slight preferences based on gender, but this is a very small factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Married (-0.0559):** This is a tricky one because you're *planning* to get married. The analysis suggests being married, in this specific model, has a negative impact. This *could* be because married couples often have more financial responsibilities, leading lenders to be more cautious. However, since you are not currently married, this factor may not be as relevant to your immediate loan application.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Dependents (-0.0328):** Having dependents makes lenders more cautious. However, since you don't have any dependents, this factor does not apply to your situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Self-Employed (-0.0064):** This has a very slight negative impact. Since you are not self-employed, this factor is not relevant to your situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Applicant Income (-0.0101):** This might seem counterintuitive, but a higher income does not necessarily guarantee a better loan outcome. Lenders consider income in relation to the loan amount and other factors. Since you are applying for a loan, high income may not be as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Coapplicant Income (-0.0226):** This factor is not relevant to your situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Loan Amount (-0.1126):** This is a significant negative factor. This is because the bigger the loan, the more risk the lender takes. You're aiming for a 150 million KRW loan, which is a substantial amount. This means the lender sees more risk in lending you that much money.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Loan Amount Term (-0.1733):** This is the *biggest* negative factor in this analysis. The longer you take to repay the loan, the more risk for the lender. A longer loan term means the lender has to wait longer to get their money back and there's more chance something could go wrong (job loss, etc.) during that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Factors Working *For* You (Plus Factors):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Education (0.0008):** Your education level (graduate student) is a slight positive. Lenders often see higher education as an indicator of future earning potential and stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Credit History (0.063):** This is a *major* positive! Your excellent credit score of 880 is a huge advantage. It shows lenders you're responsible with your finances and likely to repay your debts.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Property Area (0.0328):** This is a positive factor, meaning where you want to live is a desirable area. Lenders are more comfortable lending for properties in areas they believe will hold their value well.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In Summary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The analysis suggests that your strong credit history and the desirability of the property area are working in your favor. However, the large loan amount and, most significantly, the length of the loan term are working against you. Your education level is also helping you.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Moving Forward & Addressing Your Concerns:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that you're planning a wedding, the loan amount and term are critical factors to consider. Here's how we can use this information to help you strategize:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Loan Term:** Explore shorter loan terms, even if it means slightly higher monthly payments. This can significantly improve your chances of getting a favorable rate.\n",
      "2.  **Down Payment/Additional Funds:** Since the loan amount is a significant factor, consider ways to reduce it. Can you increase your down payment? This is where the questions about additional funds (parents' help, etc.) become important.\n",
      "3.  **Timing:** The timing of your marriage is crucial. Applying *before* marriage might be beneficial based on this analysis, but it's best to understand how being married officially affects loan terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd like to ask those additional questions I mentioned earlier. Understanding your timeline for getting married, the location you're considering, your openness to different types of housing, and your plans for additional funding will allow me to give you much more targeted and helpful advice.' 입니다.\n",

      "Okay, let's break down what the analysis shows and how it relates to your situation, so you can make the best decision about your jeonse (lease) strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of these factors as either helping or hindering your chances of getting the most favorable jeonse loan terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Factors Working *Against* You (Minus Factors):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Gender (-0.0033):** Being male had a very, very slight negative impact. In general, some loan programs might have slight preferences based on gender, but this is a very small factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Married (-0.0559):** This is a tricky one because you're *planning* to get married. The analysis suggests being married, in this specific model, has a negative impact. This *could* be because married couples often have more financial responsibilities, leading lenders to be more cautious. However, since you are not currently married, this factor may not be as relevant to your immediate loan application.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Dependents (-0.0328):** Having dependents makes lenders more cautious. However, since you don't have any dependents, this factor does not apply to your situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Self-Employed (-0.0064):** This has a very slight negative impact. Since you are not self-employed, this factor is not relevant to your situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Applicant Income (-0.0101):** This might seem counterintuitive, but a higher income does not necessarily guarantee a better loan outcome. Lenders consider income in relation to the loan amount and other factors. Since you are applying for a loan, high income may not be as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Coapplicant Income (-0.0226):** This factor is not relevant to your situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Loan Amount (-0.1126):** This is a significant negative factor. This is because the bigger the loan, the more risk the lender takes. You're aiming for a 150 million KRW loan, which is a substantial amount. This means the lender sees more risk in lending you that much money.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Loan Amount Term (-0.1733):** This is the *biggest* negative factor in this analysis. The longer you take to repay the loan, the more risk for the lender. A longer loan term means the lender has to wait longer to get their money back and there's more chance something could go wrong (job loss, etc.) during that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Factors Working *For* You (Plus Factors):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Education (0.0008):** Your education level (graduate student) is a slight positive. Lenders often see higher education as an indicator of future earning potential and stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Credit History (0.063):** This is a *major* positive! Your excellent credit score of 880 is a huge advantage. It shows lenders you're responsible with your finances and likely to repay your debts.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Property Area (0.0328):** This is a positive factor, meaning where you want to live is a desirable area. Lenders are more comfortable lending for properties in areas they believe will hold their value well.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In Summary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The analysis suggests that your strong credit history and the desirability of the property area are working in your favor. However, the large loan amount and, most significantly, the length of the loan term are working against you. Your education level is also helping you.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Moving Forward & Addressing Your Concerns:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that you're planning a wedding, the loan amount and term are critical factors to consider. Here's how we can use this information to help you strategize:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Loan Term:** Explore shorter loan terms, even if it means slightly higher monthly payments. This can significantly improve your chances of getting a favorable rate.\n",
      "2.  **Down Payment/Additional Funds:** Since the loan amount is a significant factor, consider ways to reduce it. Can you increase your down payment? This is where the questions about additional funds (parents' help, etc.) become important.\n",
      "3.  **Timing:** The timing of your marriage is crucial. Applying *before* marriage might be beneficial based on this analysis, but it's best to understand how being married officially affects loan terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd like to ask those additional questions I mentioned earlier. Understanding your timeline for getting married, the location you're considering, your openness to different types of housing, and your plans for additional funding will allow me to give you much more targeted and helpful advice.\n",

      "*   **선호 지역:** 고객님께서 거주를 희망하시는 지역은 주택 가치가 높게 평가되는 지역으로, 대출 심사 과정에서 긍정적인 영향을 미칠 수 있습니다.\n",

      "**구체적인 액션 플랜 (Action Plan):**\n",

      "3.  **추가 자금 확보:** 전세 보증금 외에 추가 자금을 마련할 수 있다면, 대출 금액을 줄여 대출 조건을 개선할 수 있습니다. 부모님 지원, 예비 배우자와의 공동 자금 마련 등 다양한 방법을 고려해보세요. 다만, 부모님으로부터 자금을 지원받는 경우 증여세 발생 여부를 확인하고, 필요한 경우 전문가와 상담하는 것이 좋습니다. 예비 배우자와 공동으로 자금을 마련하는 경우, 서로 합의된 내용을 명확히 하고 법률 전문가와 상담하여 재산 분할 문제에 대한 대비를 하는 것이 좋습니다. 만약 부모님 지원이 어렵다면, 청년 전용 버팀목 전세자금 대출이나 주거안정 월세대출 등의 정부 지원 정책을 활용하거나, 신용대출, 마이너스 통장 등을 추가적으로 고려해볼 수 있습니다. (단, 신용 점수에 미치는 영향을 고려해야 합니다.)\n",
